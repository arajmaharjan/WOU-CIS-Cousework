# Personal Project Completion Update

## The section below has summary of my work with screen shot or similar photographic evidence of product backlog I successfully delivered by the end of Sprint 2 of my DevOps training project.

For bootcamp, I begin by establishing a new personal document seprate from my kanban borad, such as a personal work list including information on the research required to complete this project. I set them up and post notes and markers on my desk as well as on paper for brainstorming. Three columns with the headers "What needs to be done," "What concepts do I need," and "What technologies will I be using" are created on the page. With this apporach I had quckily set the stage and had a list of things i needed to know and install in my system. 

By the end of sprint two, i had susscufylly connected to my aws Linux instance from Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux. I'd learn that Using WSL instead of PuTTY or PuTTYgen allows you to connect to your Linux EC2 instances natively. A native SSH client for Linux makes it easy to connect to your Linux instances and adjust the permissions of the.pem key file. 

## The section below provides updated product burn-down chart using Google Sheets.  I have two data points now: My starting backlog to burn down, and the remaining left going into sprint 2.
